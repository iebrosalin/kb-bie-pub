Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or client. Websites are potentially exposed to anyone who is connected to the internet. This makes robust authentication mechanisms integral to effective web security.

There are three main types of authentication:

- Something you **know**, such as a password or the answer to a security question. These are sometimes called "knowledge factors".
- Something you **have**, This is a physical object such as a mobile phone or security token. These are sometimes called "possession factors".
- Something you **are** or do. For example, your biometrics or patterns of behavior. These are sometimes called "inherence factors".

Authentication mechanisms rely on a range of technologies to verify one or more of these factors.
