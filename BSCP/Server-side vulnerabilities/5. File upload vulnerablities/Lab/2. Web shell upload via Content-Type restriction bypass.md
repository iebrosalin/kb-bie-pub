## Exploiting flawed validation of file uploads

In the wild, it's unlikely that you'll find a website that has no protection against file upload attacks like we saw in the previous lab. But just because defenses are in place, that doesn't mean that they're robust. You can sometimes still exploit flaws in these mechanisms to obtain a web shell for remote code execution.
## Flawed file type validation

When submitting HTML forms, the browser typically sends the provided data in a `POST` request with the content type `application/x-www-form-url-encoded`. This is fine for sending simple text like your name or address. However, it isn't suitable for sending large amounts of binary data, such as an entire image file or a PDF document. In this case, the content type `multipart/form-data` is preferred.

Consider a form containing fields for uploading an image, providing a description of it, and entering your username. Submitting such a form might result in a request that looks something like this:

```
POST /images HTTP/1.1 Host: normal-website.com Content-Length: 12345 Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=---------------------------012345678901234567890123456 ---------------------------012345678901234567890123456 Content-Disposition: form-data; name="image"; filename="example.jpg" Content-Type: image/jpeg [...binary content of example.jpg...] ---------------------------012345678901234567890123456 Content-Disposition: form-data; name="description" This is an interesting description of my image. ---------------------------012345678901234567890123456 Content-Disposition: form-data; name="username" wiener ---------------------------012345678901234567890123456--```
```
As you can see, the message body is split into separate parts for each of the form's inputs. Each part contains a `Content-Disposition` header, which provides some basic information about the input field it relates to. These individual parts may also contain their own `Content-Type` header, which tells the server the MIME type of the data that was submitted using this input.

One way that websites may attempt to validate file uploads is to check that this input-specific `Content-Type` header matches an expected MIME type. If the server is only expecting image files, for example, it may only allow types like `image/jpeg` and `image/png`. Problems can arise when the value of this header is implicitly trusted by the server. If no further validation is performed to check whether the contents of the file actually match the supposed MIME type, this defense can be easily bypassed using tools like Burp Repeater.


This lab contains a vulnerable image upload function. It attempts to prevent users from uploading unexpected file types, but relies on checking user-controllable input to verify this.

To solve the lab, upload a basic PHP web shell and use it to exfiltrate the contents of the file `/home/carlos/secret`. Submit this secret using the button provided in the lab banner.
