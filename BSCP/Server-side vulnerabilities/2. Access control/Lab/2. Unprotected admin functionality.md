For example, a website might host sensitive functionality at the following URL:

`https://insecure-website.com/admin`

This might be accessible by any user, not only administrative users who have a link to the functionality in their user interface. In some cases, the administrative URL might be disclosed in other locations, such as the `robots.txt` file:

`https://insecure-website.com/robots.txt`

This lab has an unprotected admin panel.
Solve the lab by deleting the user `carlos`.
