## Horizontal to vertical privilege escalation

Often, a horizontal privilege escalation attack can be turned into a vertical privilege escalation, by compromising a more privileged user. For example, a horizontal escalation might allow an attacker to reset or capture the password belonging to another user. If the attacker targets an administrative user and compromises their account, then they can gain administrative access and so perform vertical privilege escalation.

An attacker might be able to gain access to another user's account page using the parameter tampering technique already described for horizontal privilege escalation:

`https://insecure-website.com/myaccount?id=456`

If the target user is an application administrator, then the attacker will gain access to an administrative account page. This page might disclose the administrator's password or provide a means of changing it, or might provide direct access to privileged functionality.



This lab has user account page that contains the current user's existing password, prefilled in a masked input. To solve the lab, retrieve the administrator's password, then use it to delete the user `carlos`. You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: `wiener:peter`
