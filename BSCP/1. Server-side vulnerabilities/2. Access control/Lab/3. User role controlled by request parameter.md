## Parameter-based access control methods

Some applications determine the user's access rights or role at login, and then store this information in a user-controllable location. This could be:

- A hidden field.
- A cookie.
- A preset query string parameter.

The application makes access control decisions based on the submitted value. For example:

`https://insecure-website.com/login/home.jsp?admin=true`
`https://insecure-website.com/login/home.jsp?role=1`

This approach is insecure because a user can modify the value and access functionality they're not authorized to, such as administrative functions.



This lab has an admin panel at `/admin`, which identifies administrators using a forgeable cookie.
Solve the lab by accessing the admin panel and using it to delete the user `carlos`.
You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: `wiener:peter`
