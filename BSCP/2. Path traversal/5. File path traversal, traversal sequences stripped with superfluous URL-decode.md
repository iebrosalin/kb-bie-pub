## Common obstacles to exploiting path traversal vulnerabilities - Continued

In some contexts, such as in a URL path or the `filename` parameter of a `multipart/form-data` request, web servers may strip any directory traversal sequences before passing your input to the application. You can sometimes bypass this kind of sanitization by URL encoding, or even double URL encoding, the `../` characters. This results in `%2e%2e%2f` and `%252e%252e%252f` respectively. Various non-standard encodings, such as `..%c0%af` or `..%ef%bc%8f`, may also work.

For Burp Suite Professional users, Burp Intruder provides the predefined payload list **Fuzzing - path traversal**. This contains some encoded path traversal sequences that you can try.


This lab contains a path traversal vulnerability in the display of product images.

The application blocks input containing path traversal sequences. It then performs a URL-decode of the input before using it.

To solve the lab, retrieve the contents of the `/etc/passwd` file.
